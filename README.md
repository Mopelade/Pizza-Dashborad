## Business Problem

This week I worked on a pizza company's dataset. Plato's Pizza place is located in New Jersey . The founder collected a year's worth of transactional data with the hopes to improve the business more efficiently.

## The founder wants to find out :
* The busiest days and times 
* The best and worst selling pizzas, how much they generated and total orders
* How the business did , the total revenue and orders per month and Quarter 
* If there are any pizza, they should take off the menu or any promotions they could leverage .
The dataset contains 4 tables:
Orders - Contains the transaction info (id, date, time)
Order Details - Contains details of the order
Pizzas - Contains info on each type of pizza's size and price
Pizza types - Contains info about each pizza type like name and ingredients
